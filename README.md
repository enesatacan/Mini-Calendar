💻 **Daily JavaScript App - Day 21: Mini Calendar**  
🌟 Part of my Daily JavaScript Coding Challenge, where I create a new JavaScript project every day! The aim? Sharpening my skills 🧠 and staying consistent in coding. 🚀

📅 **Mini Calendar**  

This simple yet effective app dynamically displays the current date, day, month, and year using JavaScript. It's a perfect demonstration of leveraging the **Date object** for real-time updates! 🌈  

---

✨ **Features**  

✅ **Real-Time Date Rendering**: Automatically shows the current date, day, month, and year.  
✅ **Leading Zero Support**: Ensures single-digit dates (e.g., "1") display as "01" for consistency.  
✅ **Dynamic Updates**: Uses JavaScript to interact with the DOM and update elements in real time.

🛠 **How It Works**  

**JavaScript Logic**:  
- 🕒 **Date Retrieval**: Fetches the current date, day, month, and year via JavaScript’s `Date` object.  
- 📋 **Arrays for Names**:  
  - `weekDays`: Stores day names like "Monday."  
  - `allMonths`: Stores month names like "January."  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Updates**: Updates HTML content dynamically using `.innerHTML`.  
- 🛠 **Leading Zero**: Adds "0" before single-digit dates for neat formatting.  

---

🌐 **Technologies Used**  

- **HTML5**: Builds the structure.  
- **CSS3**: Styles the page for a clean, modern look.  
- **JavaScript**: Adds life with real-time logic.
